I named it ed. It comes from an UNIX line editor which is developed in 1969 by Ken Thompson.


You can use it with DOSBOX:

1) Open DOSBOX.
2) Write $ed and press enter.
3) You are ready to use it. 


Some lines of source code are deleted for educational purpose.
Don't be sad. I will share all part of code separately with their algorithms in x86 Assembly Examples repository.


Educational purpose is:
- "Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day, teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime."
